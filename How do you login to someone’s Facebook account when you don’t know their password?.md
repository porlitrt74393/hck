## ❓ Can’t Remember Your Username, Email, or Anything?

### Try these:

- **Ask a friend** to check your Facebook profile and send you the **username or link**
- Search your email accounts for **"Facebook"** to find the signup email
- If you registered with a phone number, try logging in with that

Once you recover any login detail, use it to reset your password via the usual flow.
