## 📌 Common Reasons for Losing Access

Before we dive into solutions, it helps to understand what might’ve gone wrong:

- Facebook temporarily disabled or locked the account  
- Suspicious login detected  
- Two-factor authentication locked you out  

Now let’s fix it — starting with the easiest solution.

## 🔐 Step 1: Use Facebook’s “Forgot Password” Tool

If you still have access to your email or phone:

1. Go to [facebook.com/login](https://facebook.com/login).
2. Click **“Forgotten password?”** under the login fields.
3. Enter your **email**, **phone number**, or **Facebook username**.
4. Choose how you want to receive the recovery code — via email or SMS.
5. Enter the code and **reset your password**.

That’s it! You should be back in. But what if you can’t get the code?

## 📭 Step 2: Can’t Access Your Recovery Email or Phone?

This is a common issue, especially if you changed numbers or forgot your old email login.

### Here’s what to try:

- Click **“No longer have access to these?”** during the recovery process.
- Facebook will ask if you can verify your identity another way.
- Possible options include:
  - Answering **security questions**
  - **Recognizing friends in photos**
  - Logging in from a **trusted browser or location**
  - Uploading a **government-issued ID**

📝 If none of these work, go directly to Facebook's **Identity Confirmation** page:

## 🚨 Step 3: Think Your Facebook Account Was Hacked?

Signs your account may be compromised:

- You’ve been logged out without explanation  
- Your name, email, or password has been changed  
- Friends report spam messages from your profile  
- Your profile photo, info, or posts have been altered

### Here’s how to recover a hacked Facebook account:

1. Visit the [Facebook Hacked Recovery Page](https://www.facebook.com/hacked).

## ⛔ Step 4: Your Account Was Disabled by Facebook

If Facebook disabled your account, you’ll see a message like:

> **“Your account has been disabled. If you think this was a mistake, please contact us.”**

Common reasons for this include:
- Violating community standards
- Impersonation or spam activity
- Using a fake name
- Posting offensive content

### How to appeal:

1. Visit [Facebook’s Disabled Account Appeal Form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/260749603972907).
2. Enter your full name, email, and phone number.
3. Upload a photo of your ID (passport, license, etc.).
4. Write a **clear explanation** if you believe it was a mistake.

⏳ Appeals can take **2 to 7 days**, depending on the case. Check your email for updates.

## 🔍 Step 5: Forgot Username or Email? Here’s What to Do

Not sure what email or phone number is linked to your account?

- **Ask a friend** to go to your profile and copy the **URL or username**.
- Try searching all your old email inboxes for **Facebook login or notification emails**.
- Use your **mobile number** if you added it previously — you can log in with that too.

Once you recover your login ID, reset the password using the steps above.

## 🛡️ Step 6: Secure Your Facebook Account After Recovery

After you’ve regained access, do this immediately:

### 🔐 Security Checklist:

✅ **Change your password** to something strong and unique  
✅ Turn on **Two-Factor Authentication**  
✅ Go to **Settings → Security and Login** to check where your account is logged in  
✅ Remove suspicious **apps or sessions**  
✅ Update your **email and phone number** under account info
