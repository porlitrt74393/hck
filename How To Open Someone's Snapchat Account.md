### 📧 2. Can’t Access Your Email or Phone?

If you don’t have access to the recovery email or number anymore:

- Try recovering your **email account** via your provider (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.).
- If it's your phone number, contact your **carrier** to get your number back.

Once you regain access to either, you can return to the Snapchat password reset process.
