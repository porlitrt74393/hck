## 🔑 Step 1: Reset Your Password

The easiest and most common recovery method:

1. Go to the [Facebook login page](https://www.facebook.com).
2. Click **“Forgotten password?”**
3. Enter your **email**, **phone number**, **username**, or **full name**.
4. Facebook will send a code via email or SMS.
5. Enter the code, set a **new password**, and log back in.

✅ **Tip:** Choose a strong password you haven’t used before.

## 📭 Step 2: Can’t Access Your Email or Phone?

If you can’t receive the code because you lost access to your email or phone:

### 🔄 Try This:

1. Click **“No longer have access to these?”** when prompted.
2. Facebook will give you other recovery options like:
   - Logging in from a **recognized device or location**
   - Answering **security questions** (if set up)
   - **Identifying friends** from photos
   - Uploading a **photo ID** (like a driver’s license or passport)

🕒 It may take a few hours to a few days for Facebook to verify your identity.

## 🛑 Step 4: If Your Account Was Disabled

Facebook can disable accounts for:

- Violating community standards  
- Suspicious or automated behavior  
- Impersonation or spam

If your account was disabled **by mistake**, you can **appeal the decision**:

## 🧠 Step 5: Can’t Remember Your Facebook Username or Email?

Try the following:

- Ask a trusted friend to visit your profile and copy your **username or profile link**.
- Search your inbox for emails from “Facebook” — this will show your registered email address.
- Try logging in with **your phone number** if you added one to your account.

Once you retrieve any form of account information, go back to the “Forgot Password” process.

## 🛡️ Step 6: Secure Your Account After Recovery

🔒 Do this ASAP:

- ✅ Change your password  
- ✅ Enable **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA)  
- ✅ Review your **active devices and sessions**  
- ✅ Remove suspicious apps and logins  
- ✅ Update your recovery email and phone number  

**Tip:** Go to **Settings → Security and Login → Where You’re Logged In** to monitor recent activity.
